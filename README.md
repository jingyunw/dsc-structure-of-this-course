# The Structure of This Course

## Introduction

In this lesson you will learn about how this course is structured in Canvas. Additionally, you will be introduced to Jupyter Notebooks and what they are for the very first time!

## Objectives
You will be able to:

* Understand the difference between a Canvas Assignment and Page
* Understand how Pages host Lessons and Assignments host Code Lessons and Labs
* Get introduced to Jupyter Notebooks

## Setting the Stage

There are two main types of materials in this course: **Pages** and **Assignments**.

You can recognize a **Page** by the following icon:

And an **Assignment** by the following icon:

**Pages** contain _Lessons_, and these lessons are mainly about giving you tons of information to absorb. In these lessons you'll be reading text and sometimes watching videos (note that what you're reading now is a Page as well). There is really not much more about it, all you need to do is to read them in Canvas. Enjoy! 

Sometimes, in fact, quite often, you'll be required to write code. This is where **Assignments** come in. Assignments come in two forms:

- _Code Lessons_: Code Lessons require you to be able to run code, but you will not be instructed to write code yourself. Code Lessons are basically very much like Lessons, but there is an interactive component to it as you'll be running some code that was provided for you.
- _Labs_: Labs are true assignments in the sense that you'll be asked to write code yourself!

You can easily tell if an assignment if a _Code Lesson_ or a _Lab_ from the title and the organization. If the title ends with "Lab", it's a lab. Additionally, Labs are indented. In the image below, you see a Code Lesson followed by a Lab.

Note that there is a third type of content that hasn't been discussed: a **Quiz**. Quizzes are less prevalent than Assignments or Pages, but they're important, as they contain questions for you to answer to reinforce your learning!

The quiz icon looks like this:

## Assignments: Meet Illumidesk!

With any assignment that you'll open, this is what you'll see:

<img src="images/illumidesk.png" width=500>

In order to go to the assignment, you need to load the assigment in a new window by clicking on the grey bar:

Clicking on the grey back will connect you with IllumiDesk, which allows you to spin up **Jupyter Notebooks**, a document-like application that allows you to do live coding!

Before we dive in, this is what a Jupyter Notebook looks like:

Great - enough _talking_, let's dive right into your first Jupyter Notebook in the next Assignment!

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned about how Assignments and Pages are the two main building blocks of the Data Science Program in Canvas, hosting Lessons, Code Lessons and Labs. Next up, we'll explore our first Code Lesson in a Jupyter Notebook!
